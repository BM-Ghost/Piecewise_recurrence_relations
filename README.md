Piecewise recurrence relations
Differences (Advantages, Disadvantages) between the 3 Methods:

Recursive Approach:

Advantages: Simple to implement and understand.
Disadvantages: Inefficient for larger values of n due to repeated calculations.
Memoization (Top-Down Dynamic Programming):

Advantages: Avoids repeated calculations by storing already computed values. Efficient for larger values of n.
Disadvantages: Requires extra memory for memoization table.
Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming (Tabulation):

Advantages: Efficient and avoids recursion overhead. No extra memory overhead like in memoization.
Disadvantages: Requires space for the DP table. Can be less intuitive compared to the recursive approach.
